                            investigated using first-principles calculations
                            based on density functional theory (DFT) and

                            (EPMA) measurements. A thermodynamic description is
                            developed by means of the calculations of phase
                            diagrams (CALPHAD) method using experimental and

                            literature. Emphasis is placed on modeling the bcc-A2
                            , B2, fcc-gamma, and tetragonal-sigma phases in the
                            temperature range of 1173 to 1623 K. Liquid, bcc-A2
                            and fcc-gamma phases are modeled using substitutional
                            solution descriptions. First-principles special

                            excellent mechanical properties. One of the most
                            commonly used Ti alloys is Ti-6Al-4V, which contains
                            6{\%} Al and 4{\%} V by weight. Despite the
                            popularity of this alloy, no thermodynamic
                            description of the ternary Al-Ti-V system has been
                            published in the open literature. In this work an
                            assessment procedure of the ternary Al-Ti-V system
                            was initiated based on the binary descriptions by
                            Witusiewitcz et al. (J. Alloys Compds. 465 (2008)
                            64-77 [1]) for (Al-Ti), Gong et al. (Int. J. Mater.
                            Res. 95 (2004) 978-986 [2]) for (Al-V) and Saunders
                            (COST 507, 2 (1998) 297-298 [3]) for (Ti-V). When
                            combining the three binary systems and looking at the
                            extrapolated ternary isothermal sections, it was
                            found that there was a very large miscibility gap in
                            the bcc phase. The origin of this miscibility gap was
                            mainly the Al-V system and therefore it was decided
                            to reassess this system. The Al-V system was
                            reassessed according to available experimental data
                            along with the enthalpies of formation of all
                            compounds as well as the enthalpies of mixing for all
                            terminal phases obtained by first-principles
                            calculations based on the density functional theory.

                            satisfactorily with a small number of parameters. In
                            contrast to most assessment papers also the
                            assessment procedure is described in detail,
                            including the optimization of the parameters using
                            the PARROT module in Thermo-Calc. Extensive material
                            is provided as supplementary material. The hope is
                            that this can be of some use for young researchers
                            just starting with Calphad type modeling.},

The results have been used for calculation of the activities of graphite and iron, and of partial molar heats and entropies in these mixtures. The results have been related to a simple statistical model, which corresponds to that previously suggested by Smith and Darken for solutions of carbon in austenite. The model involves the assumption of an energy of interaction between carbon atoms in neighbouring interstitial sites. The results show that this is a repulsive energy of about 34 kcal.},
